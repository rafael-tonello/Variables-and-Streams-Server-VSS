Description: |
              this  protocol  was projected to be more easy to understanding and
              implement  than PHOMAU. Is it based in a text file, i.e., commands 
              are separated by a new line (\n).
              Variables  and  values are separeted by a '=' char and command, is 
              put  in  the  start  of  each 'line'. To better understand, take a
              look in  the example bellow:
              
              vc:variable.name=newvalue\n

              In this example, the 'vc' indicates the command (or action) and is
              separated  of  the  variable  and  the  value by the char ':'. The
              'variable.name=newvalue'  is  the  command  payload containing the
              variable  name  (in  this case 'variable.name') and value (in this
              case  'newvalue')  of  the variable. The name and the value of the
              variable are separated by the character '='.
