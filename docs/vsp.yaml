Description: |
              this  protocol  was projected to be more easy to understanding and
              implement  than PHOMAU. It is based in a text file, i.e., commands 
              are separated by a new line (\n).
              Variables  and  values are separeted by a '=' char, and the command
              is  inserted in  the  start  of  each 'line'. To better understand, 
              take a look in  the example bellow:
              
              vc:variable.name=newvalue\n

              In this example, the 'vc' indicates the command (or action) and is
              separated  of  the  variable  and  the  value by the char ':'. The
              'variable.name=newvalue'  is  the  command  payload containing the
              variable  name  (in  this case 'variable.name') and value (in this
              case  'newvalue')  of  the variable. The name and the value of the
              variable are separated by the character '='.

              
Commands and actions:
  sv: 
    desc: set variable value. When called, the variable is turned in to a single value variable (only to prevent excessive storage usage)
    format: "sv:name=value"
    arguments:
      name: name of the variable
      value: the value of the variable
    example: "sv:root.child.child2=value"

  gv: get variable value

  gvr: response ofa get variable value

  ov: observate variable

  so: stop obvervate variable

  av: Append value to variable value. When called, the variable is turned into a accumulative data variable

About historical data: |
                        To  allow  hitorical data for the variables, with access
                        by  indexes and access of the raw data, is necessary the
                        use  of  a  raw  file with all the data and an aditional
                        file  with  metadata . This metada is the count of items
                        and  the start and the end of each item in the file with
                        the raw data.
